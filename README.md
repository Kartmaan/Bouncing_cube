# Bouncing_cube
A cube bounces against the edges of the window and against a central obstacle which contracts little by little

## Some features
- The cube changes color depending on the location of its collision (upper/lower edges of the window, side edges of the window, over/under the central obstacle, etc.)
- Each time the cube comes in contact with an edge of the screen, the width of the central obstacle contracts a notch. The obstacle continues to contract to a minimum before 
it returns to its original size
- The initial color of the obstacle changes color as it contracts
- Real-time information can be displayed at the top left of the window (cube coordinates, obstacle width, vector etc. [Set "infoDisplay" to True)
